The best story contribution app!

Stouija Board
Create the ability for users to collaborate on creating stories.  The app will allow an authenticated user to start or create a new story board.  We will limit users to 3000 character limit that a user can contribute to a given story, the limited number of characters makes users dependent on the contribution of others to complete a story. 

## Getting Started
To start the app, open the link https://stouijaboard.herokuapp.com/. The app is ready to use upon page loading.  In order to save favorites, users must use the simple sign up/sign in buttons at the top of the page to create an account.

## Prerequisites
Google Chrome (PC) or Safari (Mac) is recommended for running this program.

## Running the tests
Logs have been set at various points in this program. To see test the code, use the "Inspect" command in Google Chrome (right click on the webpage), then click the "console" tab.

Notable issues when creating this program were conflicts with branch deployments to GitHub.  Through updates, most of these conflicts have been addressed.
